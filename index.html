		<h3>Flashes of the past</h3>
		
		<p>When I came too I was in darkness and the last moments of my life playing over and over with increasing intensity.  My men fighting bravely for their homes against unimaginable odds.  Facing their leader and his pet alone to buy time for them to rally I saw that tiny man lose control yet again loosing a fireball in the the center of the fray killing both the goblins and my soliders.  In that moment I lost focus, watching them burn alive, I was gravely wounded.  My last breath cursing his name. <span id="toda">Todaflink.</span>

		<h3>Afterlife</h3>
		
		<p>As life faded from my body I felt a warmth fill me and a new duty I felt instincutally overcame me.  I don't know where I was but around me stood all of my soliders as we marched toward what lies beyond.  I their shepard, but unable to shake the final moments of what he did.  As we walked in what should have been peace I brooded and hate began to fill my spirit.  Vengence taking over.  At one point feeling a familiar voice call out to me with a velvety gruff Dwarven voice.  Beckoning me to return.  I couldn't accept it yet. I had to make sure they were safe first.  Then I would take that offer and return and jusice be delivered.

		From there I remember nothing until I awoke.

		<h3>Resurrection</h3>
		
		<p>Drawing in a long, painful breath I was trapped and I was wearing something unfamiliar, but now was not the time.  The air was cold and thin and there was no ventilation.  Thankfully, whoever put me in here left me with Hope.  Grabbing the hilt of the great sword and forcing all the divine power I could must I smashed a hole through this box. Fresh air and powdered stone dust rushed in.  Pulling myself free and catching my breath I wasn't wearing my worn plate mail.  I was wearing a suit of dragon scale plate mail.  Looking around my feet I saw bundles of flowers and lit candles.  Realization slowly dawning on me I looked above the hole I smashed in the wall and saw a small plaque reading <span id="plaque">Yalith "Hope" Andermon.  May she...</span> The rest broken and unreadable.

		<p>Once I gathered myself I reached my senses out and called to my faithful Nightmare steed.  Down through the secret tunnels of our mansion came my jet black horse with hooves, mane, and tail of brilliant fire.  Hopping up on her back I fled the mansion out through the wilderness.  There was no time to find my allies above.  I was still foggy except for something pulling at me. A single point of clarity though I did not yet know what it was.  Perhaps one day I would return to this hamlet and see my companions again, but first I had to find <span id="toda"> him</span>!
